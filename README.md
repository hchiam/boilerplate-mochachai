# Learning `mocha` `chai`

Created from https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

You can see from the [`tests`](https://github.com/hchiam/boilerplate-mochachai/tree/gomix/tests) folder that this repo's setup can do both [unit tests](https://github.com/hchiam/boilerplate-mochachai/blob/gomix/tests/1_unit-tests.js) (function input/output) and [functional tests](https://github.com/hchiam/boilerplate-mochachai/blob/gomix/tests/1_unit-tests.js) (user inputs/clicks/etc.).
